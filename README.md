Created a function called "buildTable" that clears the table body in the html document and takes in data composed of multiple arrays by iterating though each object and appending it's value inside a cell, which is nested inside of table data, inside of a table row. 

Next, a function called handleClick was created which listens for a filter button and reads the value entered into one of the input fields.  This returns a search specific to the inputs the user enters.

Lastly, a function called clearClick was created to clear any data entered into the input fields and reset the table.
